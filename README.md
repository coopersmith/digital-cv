**📍 UX Designer** @ [Foursquare](https://foursquare.com/) _(Jun 2012 - Feb 2015)_ <br>
  Following the split between Foursquare and Swarm, I was responsible for designing the new Foursquare's content creation features such as tip creation and ratings collection, as well as the activity stream, profile, and helped shape overall app information architecture from the ground up. Prior to the split, I designed consumer engagement features, including check-ins, achievements, and user profiles. Throughout the design process, I worked closely with product managers, engineers, designers, and researchers to prototype, iterate, and launch new features. These features are now being used by millions of users around the world.
